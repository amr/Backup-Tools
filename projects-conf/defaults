# Default configuration for projects backup

###
# MySQL username which have access to all project databases
MYSQL_USER=""

###
# Password for MySQL user above
MYSQL_PASSWORD=""

###
# Absolute path to the local backup destination where backup files will be
# prepared inside and later pushed to the remote server. No trailing slash.
#
# Note that this directory is not rotated by default. You can optionally use the
# rotation utility in utilities/rotate.sh but this part is not tested yet. So
# if it doesn't work feel free to implement the rotation strategy you like. As
# far as backup-tools is concerned, that directory is only used while preparing
# the backup snapshot for transferring to the remote server. It's never used or
# expected to be in any shape after that has been done.
#
# Example:
#
#   LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY="/backup"
#
LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY=""

###
# IP or domain of the remote backup server
REMOTE_BACKUP_HOST=""

###
# The remote user on the backup server
REMOTE_BACKUP_USER=""

###
# Absolute path to the remote backup destination on the backup server. No
# trailing slash.
#
# This is the remote repository where backups for all projects are kept and
# rotated. Its rotation should be configured separately (i.e. it's not handled
# automatically by backup-tools). Check the README.txt section "CONFIGURING THE
# REMOTE BACKUP SERVER" for more information.
#
# Example:
#
#   REMOTE_BACKUP_DIRECTORY="/backup"
#
REMOTE_BACKUP_DIRECTORY=""

###
# Remote Shell
#
# You may specify the command to use to get a remote shell on the backup server.
#
# The default is "ssh", but you may expand it to include more options.
#
# Example (specifies port 912 instead of the default, 22):
#
#   REMOTE_BACKUP_SHELL="ssh -p 912"
#
REMOTE_BACKUP_SHELL="ssh"

###
# Encrypt backup files, databases, both or none
#
# Example:
#
#   ENCRYPT="files"
ENCRYPT="" 

###
# Encrypt the backup with key 
#
# Example:
#
#   ENCRYPTION_TYPE="1" for encrypting with a gpg key or "0" to encrypt with a passphrase
#   KEY_NAME="admin" the generated gpg key name to use while encrypting the backup
#
ENCRYPTION_TYPE=""
KEY_NAME=""

###
# Encrypt the backup with a passphrase 
#
# Example:
#
#   ENCRYPTION_TYPE="MyVerySecretPsSword" set the passphrase you want choose very hard one 
#
ENCRYPTION_PHRASE=""

###
# Encryption algorithm
#
# Example:
#
#   ALGORITHM="AES256" choose on of the follwoing algorithm "3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH, CAMELLIA128 CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256" 
#
ALGORITHM=""
