# Password for MySQL user above
MYSQL_PASSWORD=""

# Absolute path to the local backup destination where backup files will be
# prepared inside and later pushed to the remote server. No trailing slash.
#
# Note that this directory is not rotated by default. You can optionally use the
# rotation utility in utilities/rotate.sh but this part is not tested yet. So
# if it doesn't work feel free to implement the rotation strategy you like. As
# far as backup-tools is concerned, that directory is only used while preparing
# the backup snapshot for transferring to the remote server. It's never used or
# expected to be in any shape after that has been done.
#
# Example:
#
#   LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY="/backup"
#
LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY=""

###
# IP or domain of the remote backup server
REMOTE_BACKUP_HOST=""

###
# The remote user on the backup server
REMOTE_BACKUP_USER=""

###
# Absolute path to the remote backup destination on the backup server. No
# trailing slash.
#
# This is the remote repository where backups for all projects are kept and
# rotated. Its rotation should be configured separately (i.e. it's not handled
# automatically by backup-tools). Check the README.txt section "CONFIGURING THE
# REMOTE BACKUP SERVER" for more information.
#
# Example:
#
#   REMOTE_BACKUP_DIRECTORY="/backup"
#
REMOTE_BACKUP_DIRECTORY=""

###
# Remote Shell
#
# You may specify the command to use to get a remote shell on the backup server.
#
# The default is "ssh", but you may expand it to include more options.
#
# Example (specifies port 912 instead of the default, 22):
#
#   REMOTE_BACKUP_SHELL="ssh -p 912"
#
REMOTE_BACKUP_SHELL="ssh"
