INTRODUCTION
============

  backup-tools is an organized set of tools developed here in EDC for being used
  by projects for backing up their data to a remote server.


A WORD ON THE FEATURE-SET
=========================

  backup-tools is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather,
  implements the common needs of projects. Should a project need more features
  or customization, they should create their own branch of backup-tools and add
  any extra functionality they require. Ideally, sooner or later all branches
  will be merged to become part of the base backup-tools.


USAGE
=====
