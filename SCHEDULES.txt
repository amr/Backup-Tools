OVERVIEW
========

  In order to guarantee efficient use of the backup servers' bandwidth, all
  projects coordinate together to define a time table for performing backups
  so that ideally, at any given time only 1 project is syncing its backups with
  the remote backup server.


SCHEDULES
=========

  * LiquidWeb backup server: http://atrium.edc/edc/node/187
  * Jeel backup server: http://atrium.edc/edc/node/186
